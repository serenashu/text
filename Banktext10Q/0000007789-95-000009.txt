         corporation's financial condition and results of operations that are
         not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements

<PAGE>     9
         presented elsewhere in this report for an understanding of the
         following discussion and analysis.

         EARNINGS

         Earnings for the first quarter of 1995 increased 10.8% over 1994 while
         earnings per share were up 10.7% over the same periods.

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------
         Return on average assets (ROA) for the first quarter of 1995 was
         1.32%, up from 1.31% during the same period last year.  ROA rose
         slightly because first quarter 1995 net income grew at a rate of
         10.8%, compared with 1994, while average assets grew at 10.1%,
         resulting in a 1 basis point increase in ROA.  ROA declined when
         comparing the first quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1994,
         because net income declined 2.6% while average assets grew at a 1.1% 
         pace.

         Return on average equity (ROE) for the first quarter was 15.30%, up
         from 14.83% during the same period last year.  ROE increased
         significantly in the first quarter of 1995 over 1994 because average
         equity grew only 7.3% as a result of the decline in the average
         balance of the equity component for unrealized gains on securities
         available for sale.  ROE decreased when compared with the fourth 
         quarter of 1994 due primarily to the decline in net income.  Without
         the available for sale equity component, first quarter 1995 ROE would
         have been 15.23%, compared with an adjusted ROE of 15.14% in the first
         quarter of 1994.

         NET INTEREST INCOME

         Tax equivalent net interest income in the first quarter of 1995 was
         $35.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million or 3% from the fourth 
         quarter of 1994.  The decrease from the 1994 fourth quarter was 
         essentially rate driven as the rate on earning assets increased 28
         basis points while the rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased
<PAGE>     10
         41 basis points between the two quarters causing a decline in the 
         overall interest rate spread.

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------
         The net interest margin in the first quarter of 1995 was 4.77%
         compared to 4.88% in the fourth quarter of 1994.  The decrease in
         margin since last quarter was primarily due to the decline in interest
         rate spread.  Spread declined due to the greater rise in the cost of
         funds, which was caused by deposit migration from savings and money
         market deposits into time deposits and the higher volumes of short-
         term borrowings.

         First quarter 1995 average loans grew 1.8% since the fourth quarter of

         The net interest margin for the first quarter of 1995 was 4.77%
         compared with 4.67% in 1994.  The net interest margin increased
         largely as a result of the increase in the level of interest rates. 
         The rate on earning assets increased 99 basis points, while the rate
         on interest bearing liabilities increased 105 basis points.  The

         changes due to the level of rates were partially offset by a 6 basis
         point decline in spread and a 71 basis point decline in the level of

         LOAN LOSS

         The loan loss provision for the first quarter of 1995 was $981,000, an
         increase of $256,000 from the same period in 1994 and $252,000 higher
         than the fourth quarter of 1994. 
 
         As of March 31, 1995, the allowance for possible loan losses of $37.3
         million represented 1.61% of total loans, up from 1.60% at December
         31, 1994, but down from 1.68% at March 31, 1994.

         NON-PERFORMING LOANS

         Management is committed to an aggressive non-accrual and problem loan
         identification philosophy.  This philosophy is embodied through the 
         monitoring and reviewing of credit policies and procedures to ensure   
         that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is 
         minimized.

         Non-performing loans are considered a leading indicator of future loan
         losses. Non-performing loans are defined as non-accrual loans, loans
         90 days or more past due but still accruing and restructured loans.

         Loans are normally placed in non-accrual status when contractually  
         past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. 
         Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or
<PAGE>     13
         circumstances that may adversely impact on the collectibility of
         principal or interest on loans, it is management's practice to place
         such loans on non-accrual status immediately, rather than delaying
         such action until the loans become 90 days past due.  Previously  
         accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed and income
         is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are        
         subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that
         the principal balance of the loan is collectible.  If collectibility 
         of the principal is in doubt, payments received are applied to loan  
         principal.

         Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are also
         included in non-performing loans.  Loans past due 90 days or more but 
         still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are
         both well-secured (the collateral value is sufficient to cover
         principal and accrued interest) and in the process of collection.  
         Also included in non-performing loans are "restructured" loans. 
         Restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the
         borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan, such as
         changes in payment schedule or interest rate.

         Total nonperforming loans at March 31, 1995, were $13.6 million, a
         decline of $2.7 million from December 31, 1994.  The ratio of
         nonperforming loans to total loans at March 31, 1995, was .58%
         compared to .71% at December 31, 1994, and 1.02% at March 31, 1994.

         Impaired loans are defined, by SFAS 114 and SFAS 118 adopted in the
         first quarter of 1995, as those loans where it is probable that all
         amounts due according to contractual terms, including principal and
         interest, will not be collected.  The corporation has determined that
         nonaccrual loans meet this definition.  Impaired loans are measured at
         the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent,
         or alternatively at the present value of expected future cash flows.
         Interest income on impaired loans is recognized only at the time that
         cash is received, unless applied to reduce principal.

         At March 31, 1995, the recorded investment in impaired loans totaled
<PAGE>     14
         $11.3 million.  Included in this amount is $7 million of impaired
         loans that do not require a related allowance for possible loan
         losses, and $4.3 million of impaired loans for which the related
         allowance for possible loan losses totaled $1.2 million.  The average
         recorded investment in impaired loans during the three months ended
         March 31, 1995, was approximately $12.1 million.  Interest income
         recognized on a cash basis on impaired loans during the first three
         months of 1995 totaled $148,000.         
 
         The following table shows, for those loans accounted for on a
         non-accrual basis and restructured loans for the three months ended 
         March 31, 1995, the gross interest that would have been recorded if
         the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and
         the amount of interest income that was included in net income for
         the period.

         Potential problem loans are loans where there are doubts as to the
         ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms.  The
         decision of management to place loans in this category does not
         necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur, but
         that management recognizes that a higher degree of risk is 
         associated with these performing loans.

         At March 31, 1995, potential problem loans totaled $44.1 million
         compared to $51.8 million at the end of 1994.  The loans that have
         been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a
         particular industry, but rather cover a diverse range of businesses,
         e.g. communications, wholesale trade, manufacturing,
         finance/insurance/real estate, and services.  Management does not
         presently expect significant losses for credits in this category.

         Other real estate owned totaled to $1.3 million at March 31, 1995,     
         compared with $2.1 million at March 31, 1994.

<PAGE>     15
         LOAN CONCENTRATIONS

         Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts
         loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities 
         that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other
         conditions.  The corporation's loans are widely diversified by
         borrower, industry group and area.  At March 31, 1995, no
         concentrations existed in the corporation's loan portfolio in excess  
         of 10% of total loans.

         Real estate construction loans at March 31, 1995, totaled $123.1
         million or only 5.3% of loans while agricultural loans were 1.2% of
         total loans.  

         As of March 31, 1995, the corporation did not have any cross-border
         outstandings to borrowers in any foreign country where such
         outstandings exceeded 1% of total assets.

         NONINTEREST INCOME

         Noninterest income decreased 3.6% for the three months ended March 31,
         1995, when compared with the same period in 1994, but increased 10.5%
         compared to the fourth quarter of 1994.  

         Trust fees were up 10.6% for the first quarter of 1995 compared with
         the same period in 1994.  The increase was the result of growth in new
         business development and consistent investment performance, both
         contributing to growth in assets under management.

         Service charges on deposits decreased 3.4% for the first quarter of
         1995 compared with the 1994 first quarter amount.  This followed a
         3.9% increase in service charges on deposits when comparing the fourth
         quarter of 1994 with the comparable period in 1993.  The decrease from
         the first quarter of 1994 was essentially due to lower deposit
         volumes.         

         Net investment security gains recognized in the first quarter of 1995
         were $21,000 following net security gains of zero in the fourth
         quarter of 1994.         

         Loan servicing fees were up 16.9% for the first quarter of 1995
         compared with 1994, following an increase of 13.9% in the fourth
         quarter of 1994 compared with the same period in 1993.

         Residential real estate loan origination fees for the first quarter of
         1995 were down $429,000 from 1994.  The majority of the decrease was
         at the corporation s residential mortgage company where a decrease of
         $242,000 was due to the continued reduction in loan originations
         during 1994, which is carrying on into 1995.
 
         Retail investment income decreased $137,000 or 23.3% during the first
         quarter of 1995 compared to the same period in 1994.

         Other noninterest income declined $307,000 in the first quarter of
         1995 compared with the same period in 1994 following a decline of
         $263,000 in the fourth quarter of 1994 compared with 1993.
         
         Miscellaneous underwriting fees income decreased $164,000 from the
         first quarter of 1994.  Other miscellaneous income decreased $282,000
         in the first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period in 1994. 
         During the first quarter of 1995, a subsidiary bank had a $700,000
         insurance recovery from a previous lawsuit while in the first quarter
         of 1994 the parent company recognized a $1 million in insurance
         proceeds on a key-man life insurance policy.
                  
         NONINTEREST EXPENSE

         Total noninterest expense increased 4.2% for the three months ended
         March 31, 1995 when compared with the same period in 1994 and was .8%
         higher than the fourth quarter of 1994.

         Salaries and employee benefits were up 3.9% or $581,000 over the first
         quarter of 1994.  Salaries and commissions were up $603,000 over 1994,
         an increase of 5.3%.  Deferred compensation expense declined $415,000
         during the same period.         

         Profit sharing, retirement savings, and pension expenses showed an
         increase of $212,000 or 18.4% for the first quarter of 1995 compared
         with 1994.  Health insurance expenses increased $84,000 or 14.2% over
         the first quarter of 1994 while social security expense was up $59,000
         or 6.8%.  A portion of these increases was due to the branch office
         acquisitions in 1994.

         Net occupancy expense increased 9.8% or $219,000 in the first quarter
         of 1995 compared with the same period in 1994.  This followed a 9.8%
         increase in the fourth quarter of 1994 over 1993.  The first quarter
         increase was primarily a result of the branch office acquisitions.

         Data processing expense decreased $7,000 during the first quarter of
         1995 compared with the same period in 1994.

         Business development and advertising expense was up 29.3% in the first
         quarter of 1995 compared to 1994 following a 4.2% increase in the
         fourth quarter of 1994 compared with 1993.  The first quarter 1995
         increase over 1994 was primarily at two of the corporation s larger
         bank subsidiaries due to certain promotional activities.
 
         Legal and professional fees decreased 49.8% or $239,000 for the first
         quarter of 1995 compared with the same period in 1994 primarily at the
         parent company.

         Other noninterest expense increased 4.6% or $221,000 in the first
         quarter of 1995 compared with 1994, following an 11.6% increase in the
         fourth quarter of 1994 compared with the same period in 1993.

         Within other noninterest expense, gains on sale of ORE increased
         $338,000 in the first quarter of 1995 compared with the same period in
         1994.

<PAGE>    18
         Net gains on loans sold declined $373,000 when compared to the first
         quarter of 1994.  The overall decrease in gains created an increase in
         other noninterest expense.

         Amortization of branch purchase premium intangibles totaled $336,000
         in the first quarter of 1995 compared with no similar expenses in the
         same period in 1994.

         Real estate market valuation adjustment declined $315,000 for the
         first quarter of 1995 compared with the same period in 1994.  The
         higher 1994 expense was due to valuation at the lower of cost or fair
         value of residential real estate loans for resale, including both
         warehouse loans and loans in the mortgage pipeline.  Valuation expense
         recognition was necessary at the end of the 1994 first quarter as
         market rates increased, causing a relative decline in the value of
         loans for resale.

         Repo and foreclosure expense declined $162,000 for the first quarter
         of 1995 compared with 1994.

         Other miscellaneous expense increased $143,000 for the first quarter
         of 1995 compared with 1994.

         The efficiency ratio improved to 61.97% for the first quarter of 1995
         compared with 66.03% for the same period last year.  The ratio
         increased during the first quarter of 1995 compared with 61.54% for
         the fourth quarter of 1994.  The improvement from first quarter 1994
         to 1995 was primarily due to the tax-equivalent net interest income
         growth outpacing recurring noninterest expense growth.  The change
         from fourth quarter 1994 to first quarter 1995 was largely due to a
         decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income while recurring
         noninterest expense grew slightly.

         The expense ratio improved to 2.29% for the first quarter of 1995
         compared to 2.44% at both the first quarter and fourth quarter 1994. 
         The improvement between the first quarter ratios was due to the growth
         of average earning assets outpacing the growth of recurring
         noninterest expense.  The improvement from fourth quarter 1994 to
<PAGE>    19
         first quarter 1995 was the result of growth in average earning assets
         while recurring noninterest expense declined 5.1%.

         INCOME TAXES

         Income tax expense increased 27.8% in the first quarter of 1995
         compared with the same period in 1994.  The first quarter 1994
         effective rate was affected by the $1 million nontaxable life
         insurance proceeds recognized.  Adjusted for the insurance proceeds,
         the first quarter 1994 effective tax rate was 35.3%.  Tax expense in
         the first quarter of 1995 was primarily affected by a higher level of
         book taxable income and a lower level of tax-exempt income.

         BALANCE SHEET

         Consolidated assets totaled $3.23 billion as of March 31, 1995, up
         9.4% from one year ago.  Loans, net of unearned income, were $2.3
         billion as of March 31, 1995, up 13.7% from the $2 billion of a year
         earlier.  Total deposits at March 31, 1995, were $2.6 billion, an
         increase of 5.8% from one year ago.
         
         Total assets at March 31, 1995, decreased by $58.0 million from
         December 31, 1994.  The change in assets during the quarter was
         affected by a $62.2 million decline in cash and due from banks.  Fed
         funds sold decreased $44.3 million since the end of last year while
         loans increased $46.7 million.  Investment securities increased $2.6
         million during the same period.

         Total period-end deposits decreased by $108.6 million during the first
         quarter of 1995.  The change was comprised of a $2.9 million increase
         in interest-bearing deposits and an $111.5 million decrease in
         noninterest-bearing deposits.

         End-of-period short-term borrowings increased $38.1 million since
         December 31, 1994.

<PAGE>     20
         Since the fourth quarter of 1994, the most significant changes in
         average balance sheet composition that provided sources of funds were
         an $18.1 million increase in interest-bearing deposits, a $54 million
         increase in short-term borrowings, a decrease in cash and due from
         banks of $14.3 million, and a decrease in fed funds sold of $12.1
         million.  Significant changes in average balance sheet composition
         that used funds were a $41.7 million increase in loans, a $12.1
         million increase in investment securities, and a $41.8 million
         decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits.

         The ratio of average loans to average deposits during the first
         quarter of 1995 was 89.3% compared with 86.9% in the fourth quarter of
         1994.  Year-to-date 1995 average earning assets were 93.5% of average
         total assets, up slightly from the year-to-date ratio of 93.2% in
         1994.
         
         LIQUIDITY

         Liquidity refers to the ability of the corporation to generate
         adequate amounts of cash to meet the corporation's needs for cash. 
         The subsidiary banks and the parent company of the corporation have
         different liquidity considerations.

         Banking subsidiaries meet their cash flow requirements by having funds
         available to satisfy customer credit needs as well as having available
         funds to satisfy deposit withdrawal requests.  Liquidity at banking
         subsidiaries is derived from deposit growth, money market assets,
         maturing loans, the maturity of securities, access to other funding
         sources and markets, and a strong capital position.

         Deposit growth is the primary source of liquidity at the banking
         subsidiaries.  As a financing activity in the first quarter 1995
         Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, deposits reflected a net cash
         outflow of $108.6 million from the end of 1994.  The decline was in
         noninterest-bearing deposits, which dropped from their substantially
         higher year-end balances.

         Within the investing activities cash flows, maturities of securities
         during the first quarter of 1995 totaled $49 million.  As of
         March 31, 1995, the securities portfolio contained $306.5 million at
         amortized cost of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities
         available for sale, representing 45.8% of the total securities
         portfolio.  These government securities are highly marketable and had
         a market value equal to 98.8% of amortized cost at quarter end.
         Additionally, $176.2 million at amortized cost of U.S. Treasury and
         federal agency securities that are held to maturity are available, if
         necessary, as a source of liquidity.  These securities had a quarter-
         end market value of $170.4 million or 96.7% of amortized cost.

         Money market assets, consisting of federal funds sold and
         interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, averaged
         $30.8 million in the first quarter of 1995 compared to $54.3 million
         during the same period in 1994.  Being short-term and liquid by
         nature, money market assets generally provide a lower yield than other
<PAGE>    21        
         earning assets.  The corporation has a strategy of maintaining a
         sufficient level of liquidity to accommodate fluctuations in funding
         sources and will periodically take advantage of specific
         opportunities to temporarily invest excess funds at narrower than
         normal rate spreads while still generating additional net interest
         income.  At March 31, 1995, the corporation had $13.7 million
         outstanding in short-term money market assets, serving as an 
         essential source of liquidity.  The amount at quarter end represents
         .4% of total assets compared to 1.8% at December 31, 1994.

         Within the classification of short-term borrowings at March 31, 1995,
         federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
         repurchase totaled $302.7 million compared with $271.3 million at the
         end of 1994.  Federal funds are purchased from a sizeable network of
         correspondent banks while securities sold under agreements to
         repurchase are obtained from a base of individual, business and public
         entity customers.

         The aggregate subsidiary liquidity resources were sufficient in the
         first quarter of 1995 to fund the growth in loans and meet other needs
         for cash when necessary.  As of March 31, 1995, there were no material
         commitments for capital expenditures, i.e. to purchase fixed assets.

         Deposit growth will continue to be the primary source of bank
         subsidiary liquidity on a long-term basis, along with stable earnings,
         the resulting cash generated by operating activities and strong
         capital positions.  Shorter-term liquidity needs will mainly be
         derived from growth in short-term borrowings, maturing securities
         and money market assets, loan maturities and access to other funding
         sources.

         Liquidity is also necessary at the parent company level.  The parent
         company's primary sources of funds are dividends and service fees from
         subsidiaries, borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of equity.
         The parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds
         necessary to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt, invest in
         subsidiaries and satisfy other operating requirements.  Dividends
         received from subsidiaries totaled $6.8 million in the first quarter
         of 1995 and will continue to be the parent's main source of long-term
         liquidity.  The dividends from subsidiaries were used to pay cash
         dividends to the corporation's shareholders of $3.4 million, to
         reduce short-term borrowings by $1.2 million, to purchase investment
         securities of $.8 million, and to purchase treasury stock for $.5
         million in the first quarter of 1995.  No payments of original
         long-term borrowings were due during the first quarter of 1995.

         At March 31, 1995, the parent company had $100 million of established
         lines of credit with non-affiliated banks, of which $25 million was in
         use.  Of the amount in use, the parent company downstreamed $20.3
         million to the corporation's residential and commercial mortgage
         banking subsidiaries and leasing company for their use in funding
         loans and leases.  The parent company also has access to funds from
         the issuance of the corporation's commercial paper, although such
<PAGE>     22
         funds are also downstreamed to the nonbank subsidiaries.  Commercial
         paper outstanding at March 31, 1995, totaled $10.1 million.

         The parent company's long-term debt to equity ratio at March 31, 1995,
         was 1.4%, the same as the level at December 31, 1994.

         Management believes that, in the current economic environment, the
         corporation's subsidiary and parent company liquidity positions are
         adequate.  There are no known trends nor any known demands,
         commitments, events or uncertainties that will result or are
         reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in
         the corporation's liquidity.

         CAPITAL

         Stockholders  equity at March 31, 1995, increased 9.1% to $284.3
         million or $22.56 per share compared with $260.5 million or $20.67 per
         share one year ago.  Capital continues to be strong, representing
         8.81% of total assets as of March 31, 1995.  Quarter-end capital
         includes a positive $275,000 equity component compared with a positive
         $3.9 million component at March 31, 1994, related to unrealized 
         gains/losses on securities available for sale.  Without the equity
         component, the ratio of March 31, 1995, equity to assets would be
         8.80% compared with adjusted equity of 8.73% one year ago.

         Net income in the first quarter of 1995 was $10.4 million while
         dividends paid to the corporation s shareholders amounted to $3.4
         million.  Equity decreased $383,000 from the effects of treasury stock
         and stock option activity.
         
         Cash dividends during the first quarter were $.27 per share, up 8.0%
         from one year ago.  The year-to-date dividend payout ratio represents
         32.5% of 1995 earnings per share.
        
         The adequacy of the corporation's capital is regularly reviewed to
         ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future
         needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines.  The assessment
         of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors,
<PAGE>     24
         including asset quality, liquidity, stability of earnings, changing
         competitive forces, economic conditions in markets served and strength
         of management.

         As of March 31, 1995, the corporation's tier 1 risk-based capital
         ratio, total risk-based capital (tier 1 and tier 2) ratio and tier 1
         leverage ratio were well in excess of regulatory minimums.  Management
         of the corporation expects to continue to exceed the minimum standards
         in the future.

         Similar capital guidelines are also required of the individual banking
         subsidiaries of the corporation.  As of March 31, 1995, each banking
         subsidiary exceeded the minimum ratios for tier 1 capital, total
         capital and the tier 1 leverage ratio.

         Management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and
         each of its subsidiaries to ensure that capital levels are appropriate
         based on the perceived business risks, future growth opportunities,
         industry standards and regulatory requirements.

         RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

         On March 23, 1995, the corporation announced the signing of a
         definitive agreement to acquire GN Bancorp, Chicago, in a stock-for-
         stock merger transaction.  GN is the parent company of the $130
         million Gladstone-Norwood Trust & Savings Bank, with two offices
         located in northwest Chicago.

         Contingent on the approval of regulatory authorities and the
         shareholders of GN Bancorp, the transaction is expected to be
         completed in the third quarter of 1995.  When the merger is completed,
         the corporation will have over $400 million in assets and five banking
         offices in its Chicago region.

         On April 14, 1995, the corporation also reached an agreement to
         acquire a mortgage loan company on the northwest side of Chicago. 
         Privately owned, the company operates primarily in the suburban
         Chicago areas with evolving relationships beyond Chicago.

         At the Annual Shareholders  Meeting on April 26, 1995, the
         corporation s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash
         dividend of 27 cents per share and also announced the declaration of a
         5-for-4 stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. 
         The 25% stock dividend is payable on June 15, 1995, to shareholders of
         record at the close of business on June 1, 1995.
