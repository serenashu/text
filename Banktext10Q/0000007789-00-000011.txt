ITEM 1.  Financial Statements Continued:

                              ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1:  Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management,  the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements  contain  all  adjustments  necessary  to present  fairly  Associated
Banc-Corp's (the "Corporation")  financial  position,  results of its operations
and cash flows for the  periods  presented,  and all such  adjustments  are of a
normal recurring  nature.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include the
accounts  of  all  subsidiaries.  All  material  intercompany  transactions  and
balances are  eliminated.  The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

These interim consolidated  financial statements have been prepared according to
the rules  and  regulations  of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and,
therefore,  certain information and footnote  disclosures  normally presented in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles have been omitted or
abbreviated.  The information contained in the consolidated financial statements
and footnotes in the  Corporation's  1999 annual report on Form 10-K,  should be
referred to in connection with the reading of these unaudited  interim financial
statements.

In preparing the consolidated  financial  statements,  management is required to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  as of the date of the balance  sheet and  revenues and expenses for
the period.  Actual  results could differ  significantly  from those  estimates.
Estimates that are  particularly  susceptible to significant  change include the
determination  of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of investments
and mortgage servicing rights.

NOTE 2:  Reclassifications

Certain items in the prior period  consolidated  financial  statements have been
reclassified to conform with the June 30, 2000 presentation.

NOTE 3:  Business Combinations

The following  table  summarizes  completed  business  combination  transactions
during  1999.   There  were  no  completed  or  pending   business   combination
transactions as of June 30, 2000.

("Windsor")
Minneapolis, Minnesota

</TABLE>

The consolidated  financial statements include the results of operations for the
acquisitions  accounted  for  under  the  purchase  method  since  the  date  of
acquisition.

During  the first  quarter  of 2000,  Riverside  and  Windsor  merged and became
Associated Bank Minnesota.  Effective March 31, 2000, BNC operated as Associated
Commercial Finance, Inc.

NOTE 4:  Adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")

SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as
amended by SFAS No. 137,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," and SFAS
No. 138,  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and Certain Hedging
Activities,"  requires  derivative  instruments  be carried at fair value on the
balance sheet.  The statement  continues to allow  derivative  instruments to be
used to hedge  various  risks and sets  forth  specific  criteria  to be used to
determine  when hedge  accounting  can be used.  The statement also provides for
offsetting  changes in fair value or cash flows of both the  derivative  and the
hedged  asset or  liability  to be  recognized  in earnings in the same  period;
however,  any changes in fair value or cash flow that represent the  ineffective
portion of a hedge are  required  to be  recognized  in  earnings  and cannot be
deferred.  For derivative  instruments  not accounted for as hedges,  changes in
fair value are required to be recognized in earnings.

The Corporation plans to adopt the provisions of this statement, as amended, for
its quarterly and annual  reporting  beginning  January 1, 2001, the statement's
effective  date.  The impact of adopting the provisions of this statement on the
Corporation's  financial  position,   results  of  operations,   and  cash  flow
subsequent to the effective date is currently being  evaluated,  but will depend
on the financial  position of the  Corporation and the nature and purpose of the
derivative instruments in use at that time.

NOTE 5:  Earnings Per Share

Basic  earnings  per share is  calculated  by dividing  net income  available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted  earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive  effect of outstanding  stock
options.

On April 26, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable
June 15 to  shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1. All share
and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, except
for  the  share  information  in  the  consolidated   statement  of  changes  in

NOTE 6:  Interest Rate Swaps

As part  of  managing  the  Corporation's  interest  rate  risk,  a  variety  of
derivative  financial  instruments  could be used to hedge market  values and to
alter the cash flow characteristics of certain on-balance sheet instruments. The
Corporation has principally used interest rate swaps. The derivative instruments
used to manage  interest rate risk are linked with a specific asset or liability
or a group of related  assets or  liabilities at the inception of the derivative
contract  and  currently  have a high  degree of  correlation  with the  related
balance  sheet item during the hedge period.  The pay fixed  interest rate swaps
hedge money  market  deposits,  and the pay variable  interest  rate swap hedges
certificates of deposit.

Net interest  income or expense on derivative  contracts  used for interest rate
risk  management  is  recorded  in the  consolidated  statements  of income as a
component of interest  income or interest  expense  depending  on the  financial
instrument  to which  the swap is  designated.  Realized  gains  and  losses  on
contracts, either settled or terminated, are deferred and are recorded as either
an adjustment  to the carrying  value of the related  on-balance  sheet asset or
liability  or in  other  assets  or  other  liabilities.  Deferred  amounts  are
amortized  into interest  income or expense over either the  remaining  original
life of the  derivative  instrument or the expected life of the related asset or
liability that was being hedged.  Unrealized  gains or losses on these contracts
are not  recognized  on the  balance  sheet.  The  table  below  summarizes  the
Corporation's  interest rate swaps at June 30, 2000. There were no interest rate
swaps at June 30, 1999.

NOTE 7:  Segment Reporting

SFAS  No.  131,  "Disclosures  About  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and  Related
Information,"  requires  selected  financial and descriptive  information  about
reportable  operating  segments.  The statement  replaces the "industry segment"
concept  of SFAS No. 14 with a  "management  approach"  concept as the basis for
identifying  reportable  segments.  The management  approach is based on the way
that  management  organizes  the  segments  within  the  enterprise  for  making
operating   decisions,   allocating   resources,   and  assessing   performance.
Consequently,  the segments are evident from the  structure of the  enterprise's
internal  organization,  focusing on financial  information that an enterprise's
chief operating  decision-makers  use to make decisions  about the  enterprise's
operating matters.

The  Corporation's  reportable  segment is banking,  conducted through its bank,
leasing, mortgage, insurance and brokerage subsidiaries. For purposes of segment
disclosure   under  this  statement,   these  entities  have  similar   economic
characteristics  and  the  nature  of  their  products,   services,   processes,
customers, delivery channels and regulatory environment are similar.

The "other" segment is comprised of smaller  nonreportable  segments,  including
asset management,  consumer finance, treasury,  holding company investments,  as
well  as  inter-segment   eliminations  and  residual   revenues  and  expenses,
representing  the difference  between  actual  amounts  incurred and the amounts
allocated to operating segments.

ITEM 2.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and the
Results of Operations

Forward-Looking Statements

Forward-looking  statements  have been made in this document that are subject to
risks and uncertainties.  These forward-looking statements describe future plans
or strategies and include Associated Banc-Corp's  expectations of future results
of operations.  The words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," or other similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements.

Shareholders  should  note that  many  factors,  some of which may be  discussed
elsewhere  in this  document  could  affect  the  future  financial  results  of
Associated Banc-Corp (the "Corporation") and could cause those results to differ
materially from those expressed in forward-looking  statements contained in this
document. These factors include the following:

     -    operating,  legal, and regulatory  risks;

     -    economic,    political,   and   competitive   forces   affecting   the
          Corporation's  banking,   securities,  asset  management,  and  credit
          services businesses; and

     -    the risk that the  Corporation's  analyses  of these  risks and forces
          could be  incorrect  and/or that the  strategies  developed to address
          them could be unsuccessful.

These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements,
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Overview

The   following   discussion   and  analysis  is  presented  to  assist  in  the
understanding  and  evaluation  of the  Corporation's  financial  condition  and
results of  operations.  It is intended to complement  the  unaudited  financial
statements,  footnotes,  and supplemental  financial data appearing elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction therewith.

On April 26, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable
June 15 to  shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2000. All
share and per share  financial  information has been adjusted to reflect the 10%
stock  dividend  paid  (see  Note  5 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements).

The  following  discussion  refers to the impact of the  Corporation's  business
combination  activity  (see  Note  3 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements).

Management  continually evaluates strategic acquisition  opportunities and other
various  strategic  alternatives  that could involve the sale or  acquisition of
branches or other assets, or the consolidation or creation of subsidiaries.

Results of Operations - Summary

Net income for the first six months of 2000 ("YTD00") totaled $86.8 million,  or
$1.25 for basic and  diluted  earnings  per share  ("EPS").  Comparatively,  net
income for the first six months of 1999  ("YTD99") was $78.8  million,  or $1.13
and  $1.12 of basic and  diluted  EPS,  respectively.  YTD00  operating  results
generated  an  annualized  return  on  average  assets  ("ROA")  of 1.38% and an
annualized  return on average  equity  ("ROE") of 19.19%,  compared to 1.41% and
17.54%, respectively, for the same period in 1999. YTD00 net interest margin was
3.41% compared to 3.76% for the comparable period in 1999.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

YTD00 net interest  income on a fully taxable  equivalent  basis ("FTE NII") was
$204.7 million, up $4.5 million or 2.2% over YTD99. As indicated in Tables 2 and
3,  changes  in the  volume  and  mix of  average  earning  assets  ("EAs")  and
interest-bearing  liabilities  ("IBLs")  contributed  $19.0  million to FTE NII,
while  changes in the rate  environment  impacted FTE NII  unfavorably  by $14.5
million.  Acquisitions,  net of the cost to fund them, added  approximately $2.1
million to FTE NII between the periods.

The net interest margin ("NIM") was 3.41% for YTD00, down 35 basis points ("bp")
from 3.76% for YTD99,  reflecting the  sensitivity to rising interest rates (six
increases in the Fed Fund rate totaling 175 bp since July 1999) embodied  within
the balance sheet,  greater reliance on more costly wholesale funds and brokered
CDs,  and certain  balance  sheet  sales.  The impact from  balance  sheet sales
includes the sale of the higher-yielding credit card receivables, branch deposit
sales  replaced  with  more  costly  wholesale  funds,  and  certain  investment
securities sales sold to mitigate  interest rate risk and enhance future yields.
In addition,  the lower NIM reflects the cost of funding the Corporation's share
repurchases  during  late  1999  and  YTD00  and the  May  1999  purchase  of an
additional  $100 million in bank owned life insurance  ("BOLI") (a  non-interest
earning asset). The Corporation may continue to experience  further  compression
due to interest rate increases and competitive pricing pressures.

The interest  rate spread (the  difference  between the EA yield and the average
rate paid on IBLs) dropped 39 bp to 2.86%,  attributable  to a 19 bp rise in the
yield on EAs and a 58 bp increase in the rate on IBLs.  Yields increased on both
loans and  investments and other (up 19 bp to 8.17% for loans and 20 bp to 6.59%
for investments and other).  See Table 2. Wholesale funding costs climbed 112 bp
(to 5.98% in YTD00). The rate on total interest-bearing deposits increased 34 bp
(to 4.47%),  a  combination  of a 97 bp  increase  in  brokered  CDs and a 19 bp
increase in retail interest-bearing deposits.  Reliance on wholesale funding and
brokered  CDs,  whose cost  increased  faster than total  retail  deposits,  has
increased to 31.9% for YTD00 compared to 20.6% last year.

On average,  total  assets for YTD00  increased to $12.6  billion,  $1.3 billion
(11.7%) over YTD99,  predominantly from EAs.  Year-to-date average EAs increased
by $1.3 billion (12.2%) over the comparable period last year. EA growth occurred
in both loans and investments,  with loans  representing  71.7% of EAs for YTD00
compared to 71.5% for YTD99.  Average loans were $8.5  billion,  up $955 million
(12.6%) over the comparable six-month period last year. Excluding the net impact
of the  purchase  acquisitions  and the  sale of the  credit  card  receivables,
average loans grew 8.3%  year-over-year.  As a result of the Corporation's focus
on increasing the mix of commercial  lending in its  portfolio,  the majority of
loan  growth  has  come  from  commercial  loans.  See  Table 6.  Total  average
investments  (including  short-term  investments) were up $335 million (of which
$290 million was in municipal securities).

YTD00 IBLs were $10.6 billion,  up $1.2 billion (12.9%) over YTD99,  principally
in wholesale  funding which  increased  $863 million  (46.1%).  Interest-bearing
deposits grew $346 million (4.6%) (with $199 million  acquired with  Riverside).
Brokered  CDs drove the growth in deposits,  up $575 million on average  between
the six-month periods.  During YTD00, five branches with $82 million in deposits
were sold, and 3 branches with $56 million in deposits were sold during 4Q99.

Provision for Loan Losses

YTD00 provision for loan losses ("PFLL") was $10.9 million, up $1.9 million from
YTD99.  YTD00 net  charge-offs  as a percent of average  loans (on an annualized
basis) were 0.11% compared to YTD99 of 0.19%. See Table 8.

The PFLL is a function of the methodology  used to determine the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses.  See additional  discussion  under the "Allowance for
Loan Losses" section.

Noninterest Income

YTD00 noninterest income was $96.4 million, up $11.3 million (13.3%) compared to
YTD99.  Primary  categories  that have  impacted the change  between  comparable
periods  were  mortgage  banking,  and net  gains  (losses)  on both  investment
securities and asset sales.  Excluding these categories,  noninterest income was
$72.8 million,  or $12.4 million (20.5%) higher than the comparable 1999 period,
with all other  noninterest  income  categories  showing increases over the same
period last year (See Table 4).  Riverside and BNC,  acquired in the second half
of 1999, added approximately $2.1 million of noninterest income YTD00.

</TABLE>

Trust service fees  increased  $460,000,  or 2.4%,  over the  comparable  period
six-month period last year. The rising rate  environment and competitive  market
conditions have slowed growth in trust business.

Service charges on deposit  accounts were up $2.0 million,  or 14.5%,  primarily
due to YTD00  benefiting  from the May 2000  and  1999  mid-year  increases  and
changes in NSF and other service charges.

Mortgage banking income consists of servicing fees, the gain or loss on sales of
mortgage  loans  to  the  secondary  market,  and   production-related   revenue
(origination,  underwriting and escrow waiver fees). Mortgage banking income for
YTD00 decreased $9.9 million, or 51.2% from YTD99. Secondary mortgage production
was down 82% from the  year-earlier  period which  adversely  impacted  gains on
sales of mortgages (down $7.8 million,  or 86.9%), and volume-related fees (down
$2.1 million, or 72.7%).

Credit card and other nondeposit fees increased $2.9 million, or 29.9%, compared
to YTD99.  The April  acquisition  agreement and the five year agency  agreement
with  Citibank USA  ("Citi")  provide for agent fees and other income on new and
existing card  business.  YTD00  includes $2.2 million from Citi.  The remaining
increase was primarily  seen in merchant  discount  fees and certain  nondeposit
service charges.

Retail commission income  (brokerage and insurance  commissions)  increased $2.2
million,  or 24.6%  compared to the same period last year.  The  majority of the
increase is  insurance  related (up $1.7  million)  primarily  in fixed  annuity
income (up $1.0 million) since the comparable period last year.

BOLI income increased $2.5 million, or 70.0%,  between comparable  periods.  The
increase  was  primarily  attributable  to the  timing  of the BOLI  investments
purchased,  with $100  million in October  1998 and an  additional  $100 million
investment made in May of 1999, and rate increases effective in March 2000. BOLI
income is included in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of
income.

Net asset sale gains  increased  $20.7 million versus YTD99,  due to the gain on
sale of $128 million credit card receivables ($12.9 million) and the net premium
on the sales of deposits of five branches ($8.2 million) during YTD00.

Other noninterest  income increased $2.4 million,  or 43.0% from YTD99, of which
$1.4 million was recognized in connection  with an interim  servicing  agreement
with Citi  related to the credit card  receivable  sale which  concluded in June
2000.

Net investment  securities gains (losses)  decreased $11.8 million versus YTD99.
The YTD00 net  losses of $7.2  million  were from  securities  sold to  mitigate
interest  rate  risk and  enhance  future  yields.  The  YTD99 net gains of $4.6
million were primarily due to the partial sale of an agency security.

Noninterest Expense

While YTD00 noninterest  expense ("NIE") was $159.6 million, up $4.5 million, or
2.9%, compared to YTD99, the acquisitions  (Riverside and BNC) added nearly $8.1
million  of  noninterest  expense  in the first six  months of 2000.  Therefore,
excluding acquisitions the resulting net decrease in noninterest expense was the
result of initiatives to control expenses. Primary categories that have impacted
the change between  comparable  periods were data  processing and other NIE. See
Table 5.

</TABLE>


Salaries and employee benefit expenses remained  essentially  unchanged at $77.6
million, up only $171,000,  or 0.2%, from YTD99. Despite the additional staff of
acquired entities,  which added approximately 136 full time equivalent employees
("FTEs"),  the number of FTEs has been reduced primarily in operational areas as
centralization  of  processes  and  other  operational-related   synergies  were
achieved  throughout  1999 (with  approximately  100 fewer FTEs at June 30, 2000
than a year ago).

Occupancy  and  equipment on a combined  basis  increased to $19.7  million,  up
$744,000,  or 3.9%,  over the  comparable  period  last year.  The  increase  is
primarily  due to higher  rental  expenses  and  computer  depreciation  expense
associated with computer upgrades during 1999 and 2000.

Data processing  increased to $12.4 million,  up $1.9 million,  or 18.4%, to the
same period last year. The majority of the increase is  attributable to software
and system enhancements, volume-driven
increases in processing costs and higher software maintenance.

FDIC  expense  decreased  to  $898,000,  down  $680,000,  or 43.1%,  from YTD99,
reflective  of the net rate  reduction in the combined  banking  insurance  fund
(BIF) and savings association insurance fund (SAIF) effective for 2000.

Other expenses were up $2.3 million,  or 6.2%,  over YTD99.  Mortgage  servicing
rights amortization  increased $3.4 million since YTD99 included the reversal of
$3.3 million of mortgage  servicing  rights  valuation  reserve,  and intangible
amortization  expense  increased  $1.0  million due to the  acquisitions.  These
increases  were offset by lower  professional  fees (down $2.1  million  between
periods, principally due to $1.8 million of Y2K consulting expenses in YTD99).

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for YTD00 was $33.8  million,  down $2.7 million or 7.3% from
YTD99.  The  effective  tax rate  (income tax expense  divided by income  before
taxes) was 28.1% and 31.7% for YTD00 and YTD99,  respectively.  This decrease is
primarily the result of the tax benefit of increased  municipal  securities (the
average balance of municipal securities increased 64% since YTD99), BOLI income,
and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards. Balance Sheet

At June 30,  2000,  total  assets  reached  $13.0  billion,  an increase of $1.4
billion, or 11.8%, over June 30, 1999. The growth is in part due to the purchase
acquisitions  (see Note 3 in the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements).
Riverside  and BNC  accounted for $477 million  (including  intangibles)  of the
increase  between  the  comparable  year-to-date  periods.   Excluding  the  two
acquisitions, the year-over-year growth rate of total assets was 7.7%.

Period end loans grew $1.1 billion or 13.9% since June 30,  1999,  predominately
in commercial-oriented loans (CF&A loans, commercial real estate and real estate
construction  loans included in Table 6).  Excluding the net of the $299 million
of loans  acquired  (Riverside  and BNC) and the $128  million  of  credit  card
receivable sold,  loans grew  year-over-year  by  approximately  $891 million or
11.7%.

Period end deposits grew $756 million or 8.9% since June 30, 1999,  primarily in
brokered CDs (up $759 million).  Total deposits  excluding brokered CDs ("retail
deposits")  were  relatively  unchanged,  down $3.3  million or 0.04%;  however,
excluding the net of the  acquisitions  ($337  million) and branch sales ($139),
retail  deposits  were down  approximately  $199  million,  or 2.4%.  One of the
primary factors influencing deposit growth has been due to competitive pressures
from other investment opportunities available to customers.

Since year-end 1999, total assets grew $478 million,  primarily in loans.  Loans
increased  $353  million  (8.5%  annualized),  to $8.7 billion at June 30, 2000.
Deposits increased $554 million (12.8% annualized),  to $9.2 billion at June 30,
2000.

Allowance For Loan Losses

The loan  portfolio is the  Corporation's  primary asset subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards,  a
thorough  review of potential  borrowers,  and  on-going  review of loan payment
performance.  Active asset quality administration,  including early problem loan
identification  and timely resolution of problems,  further ensures  appropriate
management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of June 30, 2000, the allowance for loan losses  ("AFLL") was $115.4 million,
representing 1.33% of loans outstanding, compared to $103.7 million (or 1.36% of
loans) at June 30,  1999,  and $113.2  million  (or 1.36% of loans) at  year-end
1999.

The AFLL at June 30, 2000 was up $11.7  million  since June 30,  1999,  of which
$6.0 million was acquired with the purchase  transactions during the second half
of 1999,  offset by a $4.2 million  decrease  related to the sale of credit card
receivables  in the second  quarter of 2000.  Period end loans grew $1.1 billion
since June 30, 1999,  predominately  in  commercial-oriented  loans (CF&A loans,
commercial real estate and real estate  construction  loans included in Table 6)
which  by  their  nature  carry  greater   inherent  credit  risk.  The  mix  of
commercial-oriented  loans  increased as a percent of total loans to 50% at June
30, 2000, compared to 43% last year.


The AFLL at June 30, 2000, increased $2.2 million since December 31, 1999. Since
year-end  1999,  the  AFLL  was  decreased  by  $4.2  million   related  to  the
aforementioned  sale  of  the  credit  card  portfolio,  but  increased  through
provision for loan losses in connection with loan growth.  Period end loans grew
$353 million since year-end, commercial-oriented loans increased to 50% of total
loans at June 30, 2000,  compared to 47% at December 31, 1999. The AFLL was 288%
of  nonperforming  loans  compared to 247% and 307% at June 30 and  December 31,
1999,  respectively.  Table 8 provides additional information regarding activity
in the AFLL.

Charge-offs  were $5.8  million  for  YTD00,  $8.0  million  for YTD99 and $16.6
million for year-end 1999, while recoveries for the  corresponding  periods were
$1.3 million, $1.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively.

The AFLL represents  management's  estimate of an amount adequate to provide for
losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  Management's  evaluation of the adequacy
of the AFLL is based on  management's  ongoing  review  and  grading of the loan
portfolio,  consideration of past loan loss  experience,  trends in past due and
nonperforming  loans, risk  characteristics  of the various  classifications  of
loans, current economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and
other factors which could affect credit losses.

Management  believes the AFLL to be adequate at June 30, 2000.  While management
uses available  information to recognize losses on loans,  future adjustments to
the AFLL may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact
of such change on the  Corporation's  borrowers.  As an  integral  part of their
examination  process,  various  regulatory  agencies also review the AFLL.  Such
agencies may require that  changes in the AFLL be  recognized  when their credit
evaluations  differ from those of  management,  based on their  judgments  about
information available to them at the time of their examination.

Nonperforming Loans And Other Real Estate Owned

Management's philosophy of the identification of nonaccrual and problem loans is
embodied  through the ongoing  monitoring  and reviewing of all pools of risk in
the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are  identified  quickly and the
risk of loss is minimized.

Nonperforming  loans ("NPLs") are considered an indicator of future loan losses.
NPLs are defined as nonaccrual  loans,  loans 90 days or more past due but still
accruing and restructured loans. The Corporation  specifically  excludes student
loan balances that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing and that have
contractual  government  guarantees  as to collection of principal and interest,
from its definition of NPLs. The  Corporation  had $17 million,  $11 million and
$17 million of these loans at June 30,  2000,  June 30,  1999,  and December 31,
1999, respectively.

Table 8 provides detailed information regarding nonperforming assets. Total NPLs
at June 30, 2000 were $40.0 million, down $1.9 million and up $3.1 million, from
June 30 and December 31, 1999, respectively. The ratio of nonperforming loans to
total loans for the  corresponding  periods was .46%,  .55% and .44% at June 30,
2000,  June 30, 1999 and  December  31,  1999,  respectively.  Nonaccrual  loans
account  for  approximately  $2.3  million  of  the  decrease  in  NPLs  between
comparable  periods.  Nonaccrual  commercial and industrial loans increased $3.5
million,  while all other  categories  decreased by $5.8 million  since June 30,
1999.

OREO was $4.0 million at June 30, 2000, down significantly ($5.8 million) from a
year ago, and up slightly ($214,000) from December 31, 1999.  Approximately $4.0
million of the change between periods was primarily due to one large  commercial
property that was included in OREO at June 30, 1999 and subsequently sold before
year-end  1999.  Potential  problem loans are loans where there are doubts as to
the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms. The decision
of management to place loans in this category does not necessarily mean that the
Corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes that a higher
degree of risk is  associated  with these  performing  loans.  At June 30, 2000,
potential problem loans totaled $130 million.  The loans that have been reported
as  potential  problem  loans are not  concentrated  in a  particular  industry.
Management  does not presently  expect  significant  losses from credits in this
category.

Liquidity

Effective liquidity  management ensures the cash flow requirements of depositors
and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of the Corporation, are met.

Funds  are  available  from  a  number  of  sources,  including  the  securities
portfolio,  the core deposit base, lines of credit with major banks, the ability
to acquire  large  deposits,  and the ability to securitize or package loans for
sale.  Additionally,  liquidity is provided from loans and securities repayments
and maturities.

The parent company's primary funding sources to meet its liquidity  requirements
are dividends and service fees from  subsidiaries,  borrowings with major banks,
and  proceeds  from the  issuance  of equity.  The parent  company  manages  its
liquidity   position  to  provide  the  funds  necessary  to  pay  dividends  to
stockholders, service debt, invest in subsidiaries, repurchase common stock, and
satisfy other operating requirements.  Additionally, the parent company had $225
million of established  lines of credit with  nonaffiliated  banks, of which $96
million was outstanding at June 30, 2000.

The subsidiary  banks are subject to regulation and, among other things,  may be
limited  in their  ability  to pay  dividends  or  transfer  funds to the parent
company.  Accordingly,  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated
statements of cash flows may not represent  cash  immediately  available for the
payment of cash dividends to the Corporation's stockholders.

During 1999, the parent company and its four largest subsidiary banks were rated
by  Moody's  and  Standard  and  Poor's  (S&P).  These  ratings,  along with the
Corporation's  other ratings,  provide  opportunity for greater funding capacity
and funding alternatives.

Capital

On April 26, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable
June 15 to  shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1. All share
and per share data in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements has
been adjusted to reflect the 10% stock  dividend  paid. As a result of the stock
dividend, the Corporation distributed 6.3 million shares of common stock, common
stock was  increased by $63,000,  surplus was  increased  by $151.2  million and
retained  earnings  were  decreased by $151.2  million.  Any  fractional  shares
resulting from the dividend were paid in cash.

Stockholders'  equity at June 30, 2000 increased to $930.2 million,  compared to
$897.2  million at June 30, 1999. The increase in equity between the two periods
was  primarily  composed of the  retention of earnings and the exercise of stock
options,  with offsetting  decreases to equity from the payment of dividends and
the repurchase of common stock.  Additionally,  stockholders' equity at June 30,
2000,  included a $42.9 million equity component  (included in accumulated other
comprehensive    loss)    related   to    unrealized    losses   on   securities
available-for-sale,  net of the tax effect,  predominantly  due to the impact of
the rising rate environment on that portfolio.  At June 30, 1999,  stockholders'
equity  included  $9.6  million  related  to  unrealized  losses  on  securities
available-for-sale,  net of the tax effect.  The ratio of  period-end  equity to
assets at June 30, 2000 was 7.16%, compared to 7.72% at June 30, 1999.

Stockholders'  equity grew $20.4 million since  year-end  1999.  The increase in
equity  between the two  periods was  primarily  composed  of the  retention  of
earnings and the exercise of stock options,  with offsetting decreases to equity
from the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock.  Additionally,
stockholders'  equity at year-end,  included a $38.8  million  equity  component
(included in accumulated other  comprehensive loss) related to unrealized losses
on securities  available-for-sale,  net of the tax effect,  predominantly due to
the  impact of the  rising  rate  environment  on that  portfolio.  The ratio of
period-end  equity to assets at June 30,  2000 was 7.16%,  compared  to 7.27% at
December 31, 1999.

The Board of Directors ("BOD") has authorized management to repurchase shares of
the Corporation's  common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available
for issuance in connection with the Corporation's  employee  incentive plans and
for other corporate purposes. The BOD authorized the repurchase of up to 330,000
shares  per  quarter  in  2000.  In March  2000,  the BOD  also  authorized  the
repurchase and cancellation of up to 5% of the Corporation's outstanding shares,
not to exceed  approximately 3.5 million shares.  During the six months of 2000,
217,800 and  930,250  shares were  repurchased  under these two  authorizations,
respectively, at a combined average cost of $24.17 per share.

Cash  dividends of $0.5272 per share were paid,  representing  a payout ratio of
42.18% for YTD00.

The adequacy of the Corporation's  capital is regularly  reviewed to ensure that
sufficient  capital  is  available  for  current  and  future  needs  and  is in
compliance  with  regulatory  guidelines.  The  assessment  of  overall  capital
adequacy  depends on a variety of factors,  including asset quality,  liquidity,
stability of earnings,  changing  competitive  forces,  economic  conditions  in
markets served and strength of management. The capital ratios of the Corporation
and its banking  affiliates  are greater than  minimums  required by  regulatory
guidelines. The Corporation's capital ratios are summarized in Table 9.

Second Quarter Results

Net income for second quarter 2000 ("2Q00") was $43.7  million,  up $3.8 million
from the $39.9 million net income earned in the second quarter of 1999 ("2Q99").
ROE was 19.06%, up 142 bp from 2Q99, while ROA remained virtually unchanged with
a decrease of 1 bp to 1.39%.  Acquisition  activity (further described in Note 3
of the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements)  impacted  the  comparable
quarter  analysis.  Financial  results  of 2Q99 do not  include  results  of the
Riverside and BNC purchase  acquisitions,  while 2Q00 included financial results
of both acquisitions.  These acquisitions accounted for approximately  $538,000,
net of funding costs, of the increase in net income between comparable quarters.
FTE NII for 2Q00 was $101.7  million,  $1.0 million higher than 2Q99. The NIM of
3.37% in 2Q00 was 37 bp lower  than the NIM of 3.74% in 2Q99  (see  Tables 2 and
3). The acquisitions,  net of funding costs, added approximately $5.1 million to
FTE NII between comparable quarters.

Changes  in the  volume  and mix of  average  EAs  (such as the  combination  of
internal  loan  growth  and loans  acquired,  offset by the sale of credit  card
receivables)  contributed  $10.7  million to FTE NII,  while changes in the rate
environment  impacted FTE NII unfavorably by $9.7 million (see Table 3). Average
EA growth (up $1.2 billion to $11.9 billion) and a decrease in  interest-bearing
deposits  excluding  brokered CDs (down $243 million),  was funded  primarily by
higher-costing brokered CDs (up $801 million) and other wholesale funds (up $544
million).

The NIM  fell 37 bp to 3.37%  for  2Q00,  particularly  reflecting  the  balance
sheet's  sensitivity  to rising  interest  rates (the average Fed funds rate for
2Q00 was 151 bp higher than  2Q99),  greater  reliance on more costly  wholesale
funds and brokered  CDs (which  represented  32.3% of IBLs for 2Q00  compared to
21.8% for 2Q99), and the sale of the  higher-yielding  credit card  receivables,
offset by positive NIM contributions  from acquisitions,  security  reinvestment
opportunities, and earning asset growth.

The  provision  for loan losses was up $619,000  over the provision for 2Q99, in
part due to loan growth particularly in  commercial-oriented  loans (CF&A loans,
commercial real estate and real estate construction loans). The AFLL to loans at
June 30, 2000 was 1.33% compared to 1.36% at June 30, 1999 (see Table 8).

Noninterest  income was $50.5  million for 2Q00,  up $9.6 million over 2Q99 (see
Table 4). The change between  comparable  quarters was impacted by three primary
components:  a) net asset sale gains (up $12.7 million, as a result of the $12.9
million gain recorded on the sale of the credit card  receivables  in 2Q00),  b)
net  investment  gains (losses)  (down $6.5 million,  principally  due to losses
incurred on mortgage-related  securities sales in 2Q00), and c) mortgage banking
income (down $3.1 million,  primarily due to a 72% decline in secondary mortgage
loan production,  adversely  impacting gains on the sale of mortgages and volume
related fees). Excluding these three components,  noninterest income was up $6.5
million,  or 20.7%.  Increases were seen in all categories  except trust service
fees which were relatively steady. Credit card and other nondeposit fees were up
$2.2 million (42.5%), due to the previously mentioned Citi arrangement.  Service
charges on deposit accounts in 2Q00 were up $1.4 million (21.2%) and include fee
increases and changes in NSF and other service  charges.  Other income increased
$1.7  million,  primarily due to $1.4 million  recognized in connection  with an
interim  servicing  agreement  with Citi  related to the credit card  receivable
sale.

Noninterest  expense  for 2Q00 was up $4.5  million  over 2Q99 (see Table 5), in
part  due  to a  $3.3  million  MSR  valuation  reversal  which  decreased  2Q99
noninterest  expense,  a $1.5 million  increase in data processing  costs due to
software and system enhancements in 2Q00, and higher intangible  amortization of
$0.5  million  due to the timing of  acquisitions.  Partially  offsetting  these
expense  increases  were lower FDIC  expense  (particularly  due to the net rate
reduction  from the 2000  combined  BIF/SAIF  rate)  and other  expense  control
initiatives  and  efficiencies  (such as  reductions  in salaries  and  employee
benefits,  particularly due to fewer FTEs between the quarters, despite acquired
FTEs). Taxes were down $539,000 between comparable quarters, due to the decrease
in the effective  tax rate, at 28.0% for 2Q00 compared to 30.5% for 2Q99,  which
was offset partially by the increase in income before taxes.

Subsequent Event

The  Corporation   continually  reviews  its  branch  distribution  network  for
efficiencies  and  utilization  of resources.  In addition to the three branches
sold  during  4Q99 and the five  branches  sold  during  1Q00,  the  Corporation
completed  in July  2000 the sale of  deposits  of a  branch  location  with $26
million in deposits. A net gain of approximately $2.9 million will be recognized
in third quarter 2000.
